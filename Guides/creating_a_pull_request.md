 #  Creating a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub


1. #### Find a project you want to contribute to.
    Browse GitHub and find a project that piques your interest.
    
2. #### Fork it.
    A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Click the fork button on the top right of any project to do so.
